==============================================================================
This repository is for the (for the moment) experimental work on features for 
NeXus file reading, validation and related uses.
==============================================================================

Provided all dependencies are met:

$ python src/nxfeature.py filewithfeature.nxs

should
* lookup the feature in the file
* successfully load and instantiate the recipe class
* process the feature and output 

The output at the moment is the list of transformations the sample has undergone.

you can use the -t flag to test the file against all possible recipes.
